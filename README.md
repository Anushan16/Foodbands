<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<br>

This application was designed for concert lovers that scramble and stumble to find a decent spot to eat late at night. After a night out to our favourite conecerts/events, our group finds that we always come across the same question.....

"Where do we eat?" 

Foodbands is an attempt to ease the decision making process of finding a quick, convinent and tast place to eat after a night out. 

* Nobody likes to go to bed after a concernt on an empty stomach...
* Plan your night out and be ready to know where to go after your concert/event has ended
* Check out quality places to grab a bite after your event!

### Built With

Our project was built with the following technologies:


* [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com)
* [JQuery](https://jquery.com)

<b>Firebase</b> was utilized for the “favorites” feature which allows users to store their favorite events and restaurants 
<b>Bootstrap</b> was utilized for the front-end design/elements as well as animations<br>
<b>jQuery</b> was utilized for DOM manupilation as well as AJAX calls

## Challenges

Along our build, we were met with many roadblocks. Here were some of the most pressing issues


* Integrate the images pulled from our API’s to match the card design layout that we created, so the alignment and responsiveness are working properly. 
* Making sure that our plugins and code used do not clash with each other. 
* Decide what features do we want to leave out and which ones we really need to get working.
* Integrating values from API calls into functions in our code.
